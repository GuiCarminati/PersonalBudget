# List of things to improve

- [ ] Refactor duplicated code in frontend javascript files (fetch requests, create elements)
- [ ] Change transactions structure to include envelope names along with IDs (back and frontend)
- [ ] Improve user feedback when errors happen (for example, when adding a transaction that exceeds the balance)
